# README #

A very simple console version of Battleship. Do not copy or modify this code without giving notice and credit.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is my own implementation of the game Battleship, with simple limitations and very simple custom console text graphics. I made this as a demonstration of my coding abilities for a job interview over the course of several hours.
* Version 1.0: Complete with 
* Limitations: The board game size may range between 10x10 and 26x26, inclusively.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Set up: There is an intellij project file preset with this program. But in general all you need to do is try to compile the 'src/Main.java' file and the rest will follow.
* Configuration: This program uses simple pure Java to run. It should be compatible with Java versions 6, 7, 8 and 9. But it was built using version 8. The main program uses only pure Java.
* Dependencies: The Unit tests are built with JUnit and that is the only dependency if you want to run them. They should be included in your system path.
* How to run the tests: The 'tests' folder has JUnit tests for each class and its various methods. They can be invoked independently to test functionality.
